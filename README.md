ðŸ”‘ Key Activities:
1. Data Collection & Understanding
Source: Kaggle Heart Disease UCI dataset

Loaded and explored the dataset using pandas, numpy, and seaborn.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized correlations using heatmaps and pairplots.

Identified feature distributions and outliers.

Detected and handled missing values (if any).

3. Data Preprocessing
Encoded categorical variables (e.g., chest pain type, sex).

Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.

Split data into training and test sets (typically 80/20 split).

4. Model Building & Evaluation
Tested multiple classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

XGBoost

Evaluated using metrics:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1 Score

ROC-AUC curve

5. Model Tuning
Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

Selected the best-performing model based on cross-validation scores.

6. Feature Importance & Interpretation
Analyzed which features most influence predictions (e.g., age, chest pain type, max heart rate).

Visualized using feature importance plots or SHAP values for deeper insight.
